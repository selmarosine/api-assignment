##Hello Selma!

First off! Nice work! I love cats aswell. In fact I have two off them here at home! I like the overall style off your site.
I dont like doing this, you know, being critical on purpose. But I guess we have to do it. Just keep in mind that many off
theese things Im about to say are things that Hans have said to me on earlier assignments. So its absolutly nothing personal
or anything off that kind. 

1. First off, I noticed the page kinda breaks a little  between 1220px and 899px. So mayby adding a mediaquery to 
address that issue. The problem as I see it is that the img "Casper" is set to an fixed width, This leaves not enough
room for both img "casper" and img "catImage". Mayby instead of using fixed value, use a dynamic value? Or change 
up the mediaquerys to flip display sooner between your mobile and desktop. So it flips before it breaks. 

2. Footer width: 100%; Footer is a block element and therefor its 100% width by default. So unless you change its 
display property or by any other way change this you shouldnt have to specify 100% width. Now with that said, I do understand
why you have done it. But I think there are better ways to go about it. While testing your page I noticed that when
a cat image takes up more then 60vh it goes past your footer. This makes it a bit strange when you can scroll down beoynd 
the footer. 
- So if you would set the "cat-container" to "overflow: hidden" you dont have to worry about a large
image overflowing the height and width that you have set up on the container. 
- remove margin-bottom 100px; since its not really doing anything for you anyway.
-remove width 100% since its 100% as default
- remove position absolut since its where you want it to be anyway



3. Lorem Ipsum - Hans told me on the first Assignment we had that there once was a place for Lorem Ipsum but that he hoped
to never have to see me use it again. Its better to ask chatgtp to just generate som random text.

4. I noticed that some elements has faulty propertys. You are setting width with vh, for example @media (min-width: 901px)
.general-info {width: 60vh;  And at the same time: @media (min-width: 901px)
#catImage { width: 60vh; First its VW for width and WH for height. 
And also, if you would have each at 60 VW it would take up 20VW more then there are room for since there can only be
100 VW total. 


5.body height: 100vh; I dont think its neccesary to set the height of the body to 100vh. So I tried and ticked it off in 
the devtools at different viewports and it doesnt seem to do anything. 

Well thats 5 things. 

So to summarize my changes: 
I fixed the responsiveness so it doesnt break anymore between 1220px and 899px by changing the fixed width of certain
elements and adding dynamic values instead. 
I changed multiple errors where width where set to viewheight instead of viewwidth. decreased the values of theese 
propertys to accomendate to the total viewwidth. 
changed the footer from an fixed absolut position to an dynamic responsive position depending on content-size.
And some small changes here and there like removing auto propertys etc.
